React Sandbox
==============
This project is a sandbox Spring boot application using Webpack and React.  

The gradle file is setup so that webpack is always run before bootRun.  There are also utility watchJS script files that can be run on *nix/Windows which will watch your JS files and recreate a bundle.  You'll need to refresh your page to see the changes though but you will not need to restart your Spring Boot app.
